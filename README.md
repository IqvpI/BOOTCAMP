This is a compilation of all the scripts used to deploy my ELK server containers.
The scripts were designed to automate the process of install elk containers and configuring them. If needed, the ansible script will be responsible for managing future VM deployments.
The final stage of this setup was 3 servers running vulnerable DVWA containers along with a jump box and a server running an ELK stack container that can only be accessed through the ansible container.
